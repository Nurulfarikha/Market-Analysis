**Market Segmentation**

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a recognized method in marketing for segmenting customers based on their behavior. It categorizes customers according to their buying history – the recency, frequency, and monetary value of their purchases.

In RFM segmentation, customers are evaluated and scored on three criteria – Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value.

Recency: This assesses the time since a customer’s last purchase.
Frequency: This evaluates the regularity of a customer’s purchases.
Monetary Value: This quantifies the total expenditure of a customer.
RFM analysis can enhance eCommerce sales by leveraging recency, frequency, and monetary data to facilitate personalized marketing and optimize cohort analysis for improved retention.

RFM Segmentation can be applied to all your customers or a specific subset. For instance, you might initially segment customers based on location or other demographic factors, and then apply RFM to these segments for further historical, transaction-based segmentation.
